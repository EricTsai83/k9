[Link](https://everdark.github.io/k9/notebooks/stats/bayesian/bayesian_modeling_explained.nb.html)

This is a practical tutorial on Bayesian inference for readers who are already knowledged with basic statistics.
The tutorial is practical in a sense that it focuses more on implementation and reasoning than on mathematical artifacts.
We will use R and also Stan, a probabilistic programming language, to introduce how Bayesian modeling works.

The tutorial includes the following sections:
1.) a basic recap of frequentist approach and critiques;
2.) toy examples using Markov Chain Monte Carlo method;
3.) Bayesian modeling using the mcmc R package;
4.) Bayesian modeling using Stan along with R.

## Lab

A set of Python scripts serves as supplementary materials for understanding the key idea of MCMC.
One can navigate to `labs` directory for more information.

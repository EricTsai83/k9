# The Task

Matrix factorization is a rather general term.
In this notebook we are particularly interested in matrix factorization as a solution to a recommender system where only *implicit* feedbacks are available.
This means that we have a $m$ user by $n$ item matrix $R$ which records only the observed interaction between users and items.
Such matrix is usually very *sparse*.

The problem is to decompose a real (or binary) sparse matrix $R_{m \times n}$ into a dot product of two matrices:

$$
R_{m \times n} = P_{k \times m}^T \cdot Q_{k \times n}.
$$

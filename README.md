# Self-Taught Data Science

The repository is a collection of self-taught notebooks for data science practices.
A notebook is written in either [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) or [R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

The major programming language used for most of the notebooks is either [Python](https://www.python.org/) or [R](https://www.r-project.org/).
